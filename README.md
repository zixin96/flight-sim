# flight-sim
This is a simple flight simulator flying over a random terrain generated by diamond-square algorithm. Challenge yourself by adding a cloud of fog to the terrain!

## Terrain Generation

Terrain is generated by diamond-square algorithm. Terrain is colored by a colormap that is dependent on the height of the terrain at each location. Specifically, sea blue, snow white, and grass green are included based on the height of the terrain.
